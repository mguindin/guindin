    <h1>Résumé</h1></br>
	<h2>Work Experience</h2><br>
    <h3><a href="http://www.sailthru.com">Sailthru</a> - Developer</h3>
    <p><i>November, 2011 - present</i>  Working as a back-end developer using PHP, Java, MongoDB, and a lot of *nix.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Query</i><p>Fleshed out query tool for segmenting clients' profiles (users) using a variety of criteria based off of client-submitted as well as Sailthru-derived data. I also ported the PHP variant into more performant Java while maintaining all existing functionality and adding new features.</p>
        <li><i>Campaign Generation</i><p>Implemented many performance and feature improvements to campaign generation code.  I am also in the process of porting over the older single-threaded PHP code to multithreaded Java using the Java version of Query code that I created.</p>
        <li><i>Campaign Statistics</i><p>Improved legacy campaign statistics performance by up to 70% by investigating and refactoring unnecessary data movement and utilization.  Designed and coordinated completely refactoring the old job-oriented statistics process into 'realtime' event-oriented statistics collection eliminating a previously unsightly and painful delay between campaign sending and initial statistics calculations.  This refactoring also saves the company money in bandwidth costs and storage of flat files produced from the old process.</p>
        <li><i>Sandbox</i><p>Created one-line development environment creation/instatiation using Vagrant, Chef, and custom REST APIs as well as an automated backend database sanitization system to get new developers coding within an hour of getting access to Sailthru repos and facilities.<p>
        <li><i>Dev-Ops</i><p>Part of my role within Sailthru involves investigating and planning software and system architecture, developing a wide variety of internal tools (like the Sandbox above), as well as performing occasional spot maintenance and performance analysis of our existing infrastructure.</p>
    </ul>
    <h3><a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.com">Lockheed Martin</a> - Associate Engineer</h3>
    <p><i>June, 2008 - November, 2011</i> Worked on a variety of projects supporting different submarine technologies leveraging Java, Unix, requirements creation and test.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Information Assurance</i><p>Helped incorporate DoD information security requirements into next-generation submarine navigator.</p>
        <li><i>Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion (ARCI)</i><p>Worked on data storage system tasks including implementation of new XML-based data parser for sonar data. 
        Also  analyzed and remedied kernel panics in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.</p>
        <li><i>Focused Acoustics Naval Tactical Array (FANTA)</i><p>Project was a result of winning internal R&D money.  Worked with 3 other young engineers to simulate, build, and test prototype for 
        novel sonar device.  Performed simulations using MATLAB and helped fabricate prototype.  Project was performed during off-hours from ARCI.</p>
        <li><i>Engineering Leadership Development Program</i><p>Selected as part of a group of young engineers to build leadership abilities through additional project work<p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>SHip Enterprise Layered Defense (SHIELD)</i> - Lead Software Engineer
            <li><i>RMMV Mock Proposal</i> - Hardware design/estimate and proposal organization
        </ul>
    </ul>
