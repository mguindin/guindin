           <p>The <b>O</b>perational <b>A</b>wareness <b>S</b>ecure <b>I</b>nformation <b>S</b>ystem is a Blue-Force Tracker / Information Sharing Device for military use.  The design of the device was conducted as part of my Master of Engineering project at Cornell University from 2010-2011 with Jack Cheung, Jason Yen, and James Wei</p>
	   <p>The device's design consisted of a Texas Instruments OMAP ARM processor, tablet phone form-factor, and a SAASM GPS module.</p>
	   <p>A simple working demo of the main interface can be found <a href="./oasis.html">here</a>.

          <h2>Ghost-Writing Robot</h2>
           <p>This project consisted of using two Atmel ATMega32 microcontrollers (AVR) communicating with each other using 433MHz transcievers.  The purpose of the project was to utilize a novel drivetrain consisting of a large steel ball (converted ball-bearing) as both a pivot and main driver. </p>

          <h2>Vehicle Dashboard</h2>
          <p>This vehicle dashboard moves away from the bulky, expensive designs that utilize analog gauges and leverages a digital tachometer consisting of an array of LEDs as well as a gear indicator 7-segment display.</p>
	  <p>The device is a latch-based design that gets information from the car's custom Engine Control Module, which was also designed in-house for the project.  Physical features of the dashboard are the fiberglass shell and lexan screen which has been water-proofed to withstand wet Ithaca, NY weather.</p>
